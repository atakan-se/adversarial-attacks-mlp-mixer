# Adversarial Attacks on MLP-Mixer Architecture

Code for my graduation project from Istanbul Technical University, Spring 2022 semester.

Used for running experiments with different models, datasets, adversarial attacks to compare the performance of MLP Mixer with traditional CNN architectures.

The graduation project also introduced a novel way to select single patches for perform the attack with, outperforming some of the existing literature with no additional cost of computation.
